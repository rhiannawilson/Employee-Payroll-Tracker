# Employee-Payroll-Tracker

This week's Challenge required me to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. This app rn in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Description

### Acceptance Criteria

THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data
